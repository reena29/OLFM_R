Online Farmers Market.

This is my Code Louisville project.

I am designing a website that is “Online Farmers Market” using which farmers can sell their produce locally and customers can
buy fresh produce online.

I don’t have any client for this website. This is a novel business model to buy and sell local produce with convenience of 
ordering and selling online.
